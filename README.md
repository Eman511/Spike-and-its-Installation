## An Introduction to SPIKE: The RISC-V Instruction Set Simulator

With the growing adoption of the RISC-V architecture, developers and hardware engineers have found themselves in need of reliable tools for simulating, testing, and validating RISC-V designs before hardware is available. One such indispensable tool in the RISC-V ecosystem is **SPIKE**, the official RISC-V Instruction Set Simulator (ISS).

### **What is SPIKE?**

SPIKE is an open-source instruction set simulator that models the behavior of RISC-V processors at the instruction level. Developed by the RISC-V Foundation, SPIKE serves as a reference model for the RISC-V architecture. It simulates how a RISC-V core processes instructions, manipulates registers, and interacts with memory, allowing developers to verify that their software or hardware implementations behave correctly.

While the primary use case for SPIKE is simulating RISC-V processors, it can also simulate different configurations, such as:

-   **RV32I** (RISC-V 32-bit base integer instruction set)
-   **RV64I** (RISC-V 64-bit base integer instruction set)
-   Optional extensions like **M** (integer multiplication and division), **F** (single-precision floating point), and others.

SPIKE acts as a virtual processor, executing instructions and enabling early-stage development and testing, even when physical hardware is unavailable or impractical to use.

## **Main Functionalities of SPIKE**

**1. Instruction Set Simulation**

At its core, SPIKE is designed to simulate the RISC-V instruction set, both in 32-bit and 64-bit configurations. It provides a simple, accurate emulation of how a RISC-V core processes instructions. This makes it an excellent tool for understanding how RISC-V instructions interact with registers and memory.

**2. Debugging and Verification**

SPIKE allows developers to closely examine the state of the processor during program execution. Registers, memory locations, and other components of the processor’s state can be inspected and manipulated. This is useful for debugging assembly code or even high-level code compiled for RISC-V. Since it is an official reference model, SPIKE provides a reliable standard for comparing the behaviour of real hardware against a well-established simulation.

**3. Toolchain Integration**

SPIKE integrates seamlessly with the RISC-V toolchain, including compilers like GCC and LLVM. Developers can compile their RISC-V applications and run them directly in SPIKE to test their functionality, without needing access to physical hardware.

**4. Support for Custom Configurations**

SPIKE is highly configurable, allowing users to simulate different RISC-V implementations and extensions. For example, you can simulate a RISC-V processor with or without the M extension for multiplication and division, or the F extension for floating-point operations. This flexibility makes SPIKE a valuable tool for a wide range of RISC-V projects, from embedded systems to high-performance computing.

**5. Reference Model**

In addition to being a development tool, SPIKE acts as a golden reference for validating custom hardware implementations of the RISC-V architecture. Many hardware engineers use SPIKE to compare the behavior of their designs with the expected behavior of a correctly implemented RISC-V processor. By using SPIKE, they can identify discrepancies and verify that their hardware behaves as expected.

## **Installing Spike: A Step-by-Step Guide**

Installing Spike is straightforward, especially on Unix-like operating systems. Installing Spike involves setting up necessary dependencies and configuring the environment. In this blog, we'll walk through the installation process using the instructions provided and explain each step.

**1. Installing Device Tree Compiler**

This command installs the **Device Tree Compiler**, which is necessary for building the Spike simulator. The Device Tree Compiler is used to compile source code into binary representations for hardware configuration.

    sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler

**2. Updating System**

This updates the list of available packages and their versions to ensure your system is aware of the latest versions.

    sudo apt-get update

**3. Installing Dependencies**

This command installs the essential dependencies for building Spike. **Autoconf** and **automake** generate build configurations, while **gcc** and **g++** are the compilers needed for code compilation. **Git** helps clone the repository, and **libtool** simplifies handling shared libraries. Lastly, **zlib1g-dev** provides the compression library required for building components that need compression support.

    sudo apt-get install autoconf automake gcc git g++ libtool zlib1g-dev

**4. Cloning the Spike Repository**

This command clones the **Spike RISC-V ISA Simulator** repository from GitHub. It fetches the latest source code needed to compile and install the Spike simulator.

    git clone https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim.git

**5. Building Spike**

This navigates into the cloned Spike repository.

    cd riscv-isa-sim

This creates a new directory called **build** where the Spike simulator will be compiled.

    mkdir build

Moves into the newly created build directory.

    cd build

**6. Configuring and Compiling Spike**

This runs the configuration script to prepare for the build process. The --prefix=/opt/riscv argument specifies that the Spike simulator should be installed in the /opt/riscv directory.

    ../configure --prefix=/opt/riscv

The make command compiles the source code. The -j$(nproc) flag utilizes all available CPU cores to speed up the build process.

    make -j$(nproc)

This installs the compiled Spike binaries into the /opt/riscv directory.

    sudo make install

**7. Setting Up Environment Variables**

Navigates to your home directory.

    cd ~

Opens the .bashrc file in the **nano** text editor. The .bashrc file is a script that runs whenever you open a new terminal session. You’ll modify this file to include the newly installed Spike binaries in your system’s PATH.

    nano ~/.bashrc

**8. Adding Spike to PATH**

This command appends the directory /opt/riscv/bin to the system’s $PATH environment variable, ensuring that the Spike commands can be executed from any directory in the terminal.

    export PATH=/opt/riscv/bin:$PATH

After editing the .bashrc file, this command reloads it to apply the changes immediately.

    source ~/.bashrc

**9. Testing Spike**

This command checks whether Spike is installed correctly by displaying a help message. If Spike is correctly installed, this command will print a list of available options and usage information.

    spike --help

## **Installing the RISC-V Toolchain**

After setting up Spike, you will need the RISC-V Toolchain to compile programs for RISC-V targets.

**1. Installing the RISC-V Toolchain**

This command installs the RISC-V **GCC cross-compiler** toolchain. It is used to compile C and C++ code for RISC-V targets. The gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf package allows compiling programs to run on the RISC-V ISA.

    sudo apt-get install gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf

**2. Verifying the Installation**

This command checks if the RISC-V GCC toolchain was installed correctly by printing the version of the RISC-V GCC compiler. If the installation was successful, the toolchain version will be displayed in the terminal.

    riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc --version

## **Conclusion**

With these steps, you should now have the **Spike RISC-V simulator** and the **RISC-V toolchain** installed on your system. These tools are essential for developing and simulating RISC-V applications. Spike allows you to simulate the behaviour of RISC-V instructions, while the toolchain lets you compile and test your code.
